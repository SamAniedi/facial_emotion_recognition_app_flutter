Sadness can be coined with different words such as agony, broken hearted, sorry, dismay, homesickness, and many more. Same as other feelings, it occurs at the same time like stress, grief, guilt, anxiety or hopelessness.  There are times that we don’t realize or we are not aware ourselves that we are sad when the other feelings are strong and suppressing.",
    "Sadness can also change how we feel physically and emotionally. Physically speaking, you may get a headache or a stomach ache, and sometimes, we’re having a hard time going to sleep. In terms of emotionally, we get teary, grumpy, frustrated, or we try to keep ourselves away from people; even to our loved ones and friends. "
